Upgrowth Coding Assignment:

* Using the Unsplash API described here -Â https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photosÂ - create a micro app that allows a user to search for a tag and show the matching photos.
* The request will need an API key, documented here -Â https://unsplash.com/documentation#public-actions
* The app should be written in react, and it should be styled to be visually pleasing - use any libraries/frameworks youâ€™d like to.
* Use codepen, plunkr ,Â repl.itÂ or similar to host the app so we can see your source and the application running, and share the link with us when youâ€™re done.
